- We want to develop a clock system that allows us to:
    * Reliably get the current time and duration of a frame
    * Pause and scale gameplay time values independent of the other parts of the program
    * Reset the time, or even feed the clock our own values
    * Work with both variable and fixed frame duration* Avoi artifacts caused by consecutive frames with very different durations
    * Avoid precision problems
    
- Separate two concepts: clocks and timers

- Time artifacts
    * Spikes
