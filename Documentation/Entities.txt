* The engine will be divided by entities, each one representing a sub-system of the engine. Those are:
    - Core
        > here we will have the managers of the engine, wich will define how each entity relate to each other
    - audio
        > with the help of fmod, here i will develop a layer to use it
    - physics
        > powered by box2D, here i will handle all the physics stuff
    - graphics
        > rendering, matrics transformations, opengl, shaders...
